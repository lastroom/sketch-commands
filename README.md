# LastRoom Sketch Commands

Sketch Commands is a freestyle port of my [Orange Commands for Fireworks](http://orangecommands.com) for Bohemian Codingâ€™s [Sketch.app](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).

It works both with the App Store and the non-sandboxed versions of Sketch (i.e: the beta).


## Installation

1. [Download the ZIP file with the commands](https://github.com/lastroom/sketch-commands/zipball/master)
2. Copy the contents of the ZIP to `~/Library/Application Support/sketch/Plugins` (if you're using the App Store version of Sketch, you need to copy them to `~/Library/Containers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch/Data/Library/Application Support/sketch/Plugins`)


## More info

If you are curious about scripting Sketch, here's a link to the official [Sketch Scripting API documentation](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/scripting/).
